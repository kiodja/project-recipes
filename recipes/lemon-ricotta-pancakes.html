    <h1>Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes</h1>
    <div class="header">
    <p>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites. Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>

            <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>

        </ol>
